Student placement prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVM) deployed by Flask is a system designed to predict whether a student will be placed in a company based on certain features or attributes. Here's an overview of how such a system might work:

Overview:
Objective: To predict whether a student will be placed in a company based on various factors such as academic performance, skills, and other relevant attributes.

Methodology: Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. Flask, a Python web framework, is used to deploy the SVM model as a web application.Student placement prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVM) deployed by Flask is a system designed to predict whether a student will be placed in a company based on certain features or attributes.
